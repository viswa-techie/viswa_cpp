## Problem Statement

Write a C++ program that solves the Sort by sign problem.

### Examples
- **Input Example 1:** A typical/simple case
- **Input Example 2:** An edge case (empty input, boundary values)
- **Input Example 3:** A larger or tricky case

---

## Prerequisites
- Basic C++ syntax (variables, types, operators)
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Array/vector basics

---

## Core Concept

### What Is It?
Sort by sign is a classic problem in C++ that appears frequently in interviews and real projects.

### Why Does It Matter?
- Builds problem-solving muscle for algorithmic thinking
- Commonly asked in technical interviews
- Helps write clean, maintainable code

### Mental Model
Think of sort by sign as a puzzle — break it into smaller pieces and solve each one.

## Solution Approaches

### Approach 1: Direct / Straightforward
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

/*
 * Sort by sign
 * 
 * Approach: Direct implementation
 * Time Complexity:  O(n) — typical for this type of problem
 * Space Complexity: O(1) — or O(n) if storing results
 */
int main() {
    // TODO: Implement Sort by sign
    // Step 1: Read input
    // Step 2: Process
    // Step 3: Output result
    
    std::cout << "Solution for: Sort by sign" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n) (typical)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1) or O(n)  
**When to use:** First attempt, when simplicity matters over performance.

### Approach 2: Optimized / STL-Based
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <numeric>

/*
 * Sort by sign — Optimized approach using STL
 * 
 * Uses standard library algorithms where applicable.
 * Generally preferred in production C++ code.
 */
int main() {
    // TODO: STL-based implementation
    // Use std::sort, std::find, std::accumulate, etc. as appropriate
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Time Complexity:** Depends on STL algorithm used  
**Space Complexity:** Depends on approach  
**When to use:** Production code, when you know the right STL tool.

### Approach 3: Modern C++ (C++17/20)
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/*
 * Sort by sign — Modern C++ approach
 * 
 * Uses features from C++17/20: structured bindings,
 * if-init, ranges, constexpr, etc.
 */
int main() {
    // TODO: Modern C++ implementation
    // Use auto, structured bindings, ranges, etc.
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Step-by-Step Trace

For a typical input, trace the solution:

| Step | State | Action | Result |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Initial | Read input | — |
| 2 | Processing | Apply algorithm | — |
| 3 | Final | Output result | — |

## Common Mistakes & Pitfalls

1. **Off-by-one errors** — Check loop boundaries carefully
2. **Uninitialized variables** — Always initialize before use
3. **Integer overflow** — Use `long long` for large numbers
4. **Missing edge cases** — Empty input, single element, negative numbers
5. **Forgetting `#include`** — Include all necessary headers
6. **Using `==` vs `=`** — Assignment vs comparison

## What You Should Learn From This

### Key C++ Feature Demonstrated
- Sort by sign demonstrates loop control and algorithmic thinking

### Interview Tips
- Start with brute force, then optimize
- Always discuss time/space complexity
- Mention edge cases proactively

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Compiles with `-Wall -Wextra` — no warnings
- [ ] Handles edge cases
- [ ] Variables are properly initialized
- [ ] No memory leaks (if using dynamic allocation)
- [ ] Code is readable and well-commented

## Practice Variants
1. **Easy:** Simplify the constraints (smaller input, fewer edge cases)
2. **Medium:** Add a constraint (handle negative numbers, optimize for time)
3. **Hard:** Combine with another concept (recursion, dynamic programming)

## Quick Reference Card
- **Core idea:** Sort by sign
- **Key construct:** Loops
- **Complexity:** O(n) typical
- **Don't forget:** Initialize variables, check edge cases, use `-Wall`
