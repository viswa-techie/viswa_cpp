## Overview

Level 3 is the data-structures chapter that every software engineer is tested on. You master the full STL container library, then build fundamental linked/sequential structures manually (to understand pointer mechanics), and finally tackle hashing — the engine behind O(1) lookup. After Level 3 you can solve 90%+ of LeetCode Easy and ~50% of Medium problems.

## C22 — STL Containers & Iterators (130 files)

### What is Covered

| Range | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| 001–010 | `std::vector` (all operations), `std::deque`, `std::list`, `std::forward_list`, `std::array`; `std::string` as container |
| 011–020 | `std::stack`, `std::queue`, `std::priority_queue` (max/min heap); adaptor pattern over underlying containers |
| 021–030 | `std::set`, `std::multiset`, `std::map`, `std::multimap` — red-black tree internals; `lower_bound`/`upper_bound` on ordered containers |
| 031–040 | `std::unordered_set`, `std::unordered_map`, `std::unordered_multiset/map` — hash table internals, load factor, rehash |
| 041–050 | `std::bitset`, `std::valarray`, `std::span` (C++20), `std::mdspan` (C++23); byte-level containers |
| 051–060 | Iterator categories: input, output, forward, bidirectional, random-access, contiguous; iterator invalidation rules |
| 061–070 | `std::begin/end`, `std::advance`, `std::distance`, `std::next`, `std::prev`; reverse iterators; stream iterators |
| 071–080 | `<algorithm>` core: `std::sort`, `std::find`, `std::count`, `std::transform`, `std::copy`, `std::accumulate`, `std::reduce` |
| 081–090 | `<algorithm>` advanced: `std::partition`, `std::nth_element`, `std::stable_sort`, `std::merge`, `std::set_intersection`, `std::unique` |
| 091–100 | C++17/20 algorithms: `std::for_each` with CTAD, parallel STL (`std::execution::par`), `std::ranges` intro |
| 101–110 | `std::ranges`: range adaptors, pipe `|`, `views::filter`, `views::transform`, `views::take`, lazy evaluation |
| 111–120 | `std::views::join`, `std::views::zip` (C++23), `std::views::enumerate` (C++23), `std::views::chunk`, `std::generator` |
| 121–130 | Heap problems with `priority_queue`: two-heap median, K closest elements, Kth largest, top-K frequent; C++26 `std::inplace_vector`; `std::flat_map`/`std::flat_set` (C++23) |

### Key Concepts Learned
- `std::vector` is contiguous; `std::list` is pointer-linked — cache impact is enormous
- Ordered containers (`set`/`map`) = O(log n) but sorted; unordered = O(1) amortised but no order
- Iterator invalidation: `push_back` can invalidate all vector iterators; know the rules per container
- `std::ranges` is lazy — no computation until iterated
- `std::nth_element` is O(n) average for partial sorting (uses introselect)

### Patterns Introduced
- **Two-heap pattern** — maintain median of stream
- **Lazy range pipeline** — `nums | views::filter | views::transform`
- **Iterator erasure idiom** — `v.erase(std::remove(...), v.end())`

## C30 — Linked Lists (120 files)

### What is Covered

| Range | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| 001–010 | Singly linked list (manual impl), doubly linked list, circular linked list, XOR linked list; insert at head/tail/position |
| 011–020 | Delete by value/position, search, length; reverse a singly linked list (iterative + recursive) |
| 021–030 | Floyd's cycle detection (tortoise & hare), cycle start detection, cycle removal |

| 111–120 | Skip list O(1) random access, doubly linked list as deque, circular buffer with list, embedded systems list (no heap) |

### Key Concepts Learned
- Linked list has O(1) insert/delete at known position; O(n) random access
- Fast/slow pointer: after k iterations, fast has moved 2k nodes — finds midpoint in one pass
- Floyd's cycle detection: meet inside cycle → distance from head = distance from meeting point to cycle start
- LRU cache: O(1) get + O(1) put using `unordered_map` + `std::list`
- Deep copy of a list with random pointers needs a mapping from old → new nodes

### Patterns Introduced
- **Fast/Slow Pointer (Two Pointers on list)**
- **Dummy head node** — simplifies edge cases at head
- **Reverse in-place** — three-pointer technique
- **Floyd's Cycle Detection**

## C31 — Stacks & Queues (115 files)

### What is Covered

| Range | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| 001–010 | Stack (array impl, linked list impl, `std::stack`, `std::vector`); Queue (circular array, linked list, `std::queue`, `std::deque`) |
| 011–020 | Monotonic stack: next greater element, next smaller element, stock span problem; daily temperatures |
| 021–030 | Balanced parentheses, evaluate reverse Polish notation (RPN), infix to postfix conversion, calculator |
| 031–040 | Min stack (O(1) getMin), max stack; queue using two stacks; stack using two queues |
| 041–050 | Largest rectangle in histogram (monotonic stack), maximal rectangle (extend histogram row by row) |
| 051–060 | BFS via queue: level-order traversal, shortest path in unweighted graph, 01-matrix, rotting oranges |
| 061–070 | Priority queue patterns: K-way merge, sliding window maximum, task scheduler |
| 071–080 | Deque applications: sliding window min/max (monotonic deque), palindrome check with deque |
| 081–090 | `std::deque` internals (block-based), memory layout comparison with vector |
| 091–100 | Circular queue / ring buffer implementation; producer-consumer with bounded queue (lock-based) |
| 101–115 | Monotonic queue problems: shortest subarray with sum ≥ K, jump game VI; priority-queue-based graph algorithms preview |

### Key Concepts Learned
- Monotonic stack maintains sorted order → solves "next greater/smaller" in O(n)
- Queue = FIFO = natural for BFS (process level by level)
- Stack = LIFO = natural for DFS, function call simulation, expression evaluation
- Min-stack trick: store `(value, current_min)` pairs or use auxiliary stack
- Histogram rectangle: for each bar, find left/right boundary of shorter bars — monotonic stack!

### Patterns Introduced
- **Monotonic Stack** — next greater/smaller element family
- **BFS with Queue** — shortest path, level-order
- **Two-Stack Queue** — amortised O(1) enqueue/dequeue
- **Sliding Window with Deque** — O(n) window maximum/minimum

## C32 — Hashing (110 files)

### What is Covered

| Range | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| 001–010 | Hash function design, division method, multiplication method, universal hashing, perfect hashing concept |
| 011–020 | Chaining (separate chaining), open addressing (linear probing), quadratic probing, double hashing |
| 021–030 | Load factor, rehashing trigger, amortised analysis of insertions; dynamic resizing |
| 031–040 | `std::unordered_map` internals: bucket count, `max_load_factor()`, `reserve()`, custom hash functions |
| 041–050 | Custom hash: `std::hash` specialisation, hash combining (`seed ^= hash(v) + 0x9e3779b9 ...`), hashing pairs/tuples |
| 051–060 | Two Sum / Count pairs, frequency maps, group anagrams, isomorphic strings, word pattern |
| 061–070 | LRU cache, all O(1) data structure, design Twitter feed (hash + heap), design phone book |

| 101–110 | Cuckoo hashing, Robin Hood hashing, cache-efficient hash table; fingerprinting for file deduplication; hash collision probability analysis |

### Key Concepts Learned
- A good hash distributes uniformly → average O(1) operations
- Separate chaining: simple, degrades to O(n) worst case in one bucket
- Open addressing: better cache performance, sensitive to load factor (keep < 0.7)
- Why hash maps are not ordered — iteration order is non-deterministic
- Rolling hash: slide a window in O(1) by adding new char and removing old
- Bloom filter: space-efficient probabilistic membership test (false positives, no false negatives)

### Patterns Introduced
- **Frequency Map** — count occurrences in O(n)
- **Two Sum via Hash** — store complement as key
- **Rolling Hash** — O(n) substring search (Rabin-Karp)
- **Consistent Hashing** — distributed key-node mapping

## Common Mistakes at Level 3

| Mistake | Correct Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| Using `map` when order doesn't matter | Use `unordered_map` for O(1) average |
| Hashing `pair<int,int>` without custom hash | Provide `struct PairHash` |
| Forgetting dummy head node in linked list | Always add dummy head for uniform logic |
| Not handling stack empty before pop | Check `!stack.empty()` before every pop |
| Assuming `unordered_map` iteration order | Order is undefined — use `map` if order needed |
| Using `std::list::size()` expecting O(1) | Since C++11 it IS O(1), but know the history |

## Interview Focus (Level 3 Topics)
